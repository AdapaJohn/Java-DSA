//Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the fast pointer, which moves quicker, will either reach the end of the list (in case of no loop) or meet the slow pointer (in case of a loop) in a linear time relative to the length of the list.
//The key insight into why this is O(N) and not something slower is that each step of the algorithm reduces the distance between the fast and slow pointers (when they are in the loop) by one. Therefore, the maximum number of steps needed for them to meet is proportional to the number of nodes in the list.
//Space Complexity : O(1) The code uses only a constantamount of additionalspace, regardless of the linked list's length. This is achieved by using two pointers (slow and fast) to detect the loop without any significant extra memory usage, resulting in constantspace complexity, O(1).
