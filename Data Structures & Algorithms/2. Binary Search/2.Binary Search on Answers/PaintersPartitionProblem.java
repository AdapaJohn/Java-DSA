//Time Complexity: O(N * (sum(arr[])-max(arr[])+1)), where N = size of the array, sum(arr[]) = sum of all array elements, max(arr[]) = maximum of all array elements.Reason: We are using a loop from max(arr[]) to sum(arr[]) to check all possible values of time. Inside the loop, we are calling the countPainters() function for each number. Now, inside the countPainters() function, we are using a loop that runs for N times.
//Space Complexity:  O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
